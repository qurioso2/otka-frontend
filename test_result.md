        comment: "❌ CRITICAL: Middleware bug - /parteneri landing page is incorrectly protected and redirects to login. The middleware logic on line 13 uses startsWith('/parteneri') which catches the base /parteneri path, but this should be accessible without authentication. Only /parteneri/dashboard should be protected."
